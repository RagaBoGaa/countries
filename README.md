### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool
- [React-Router v.6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Routing & fetching data from API
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & Grid
- JSX syntax
- Hooks (useEffect, useNavigate, useParams)

### What I learned

To think more in react logic and deal with REST-API, and to fetch data through `ReactRouter` v.6 and navigate between countries in the same page (when click on some border country it navigates to that country without refreshing the page)

### Continued development

Build more projects with Reactjs
